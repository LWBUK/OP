05:03:13 : Group: Daryl: ok
05:05:16 : Group: Daryl: :D
05:05:26 : Group: Daryl: what mission you wanna do?
05:05:33 : Group: Logan: these guns have ammo so if you can fly by a mission i can shoot
05:05:53 : Group: Logan: lets do disabled HMMWV
05:06:06 : Group: Logan: the bandit one to the west of us
05:06:09 : Group: Daryl: il fly by slow but if they have gunners wel have to leave em
05:06:19 : Group: Logan: youre right
05:06:36 : Group: Daryl: they probably will have gunners tbh
05:06:50 : Group: Daryl: i can land at a camp and try to get you a sniper?
05:06:53 : Group: Logan: if they dont have m2s we might be fine
05:07:04 : Group: Logan: if they have gunners we can do that
05:07:19 : Group: Daryl: lol it just despawned
05:07:27 : Group: Logan: Yeah.....
05:07:40 : Group: Logan: we can go to a camp and see what loot they have
05:07:40 : Group: Daryl: convoy definetley has lots of gunners
05:07:53 : Group: Logan: go to novy camp
05:08:05 : Group: Daryl: you gonna shoot the ai from heli?
05:08:08 : Group: Daryl: or go in on foot
05:08:20 : Group: Logan: heli and if you take fire just land and we can get them on foot
05:10:17 : Group: Daryl: think its clear?
05:10:25 : Group: Daryl: 1 more
05:10:57 : Group: Logan: out of ammo
05:11:10 : Group: Logan: lets get him on foot
05:14:40 : Group: Daryl: mk17 cco
05:15:49 : Group: Logan: the reason i shot so much in the heli is because it didnt give me any kills on my debug console
05:16:02 : Group: Daryl: ahh yeah i figured it wouldnt
05:16:18 : Group: Daryl: i think its something with armed vehicles that arent in normal epoch
05:16:38 : Group: Daryl: thats why like only gunners shoot at overwatch/militarized mod vehicles
05:17:25 : Group: Daryl: lmk if you find any dmr mags, might need some for that mission
05:18:06 : Group: Daryl: acr sd
05:18:38 : Group: Daryl: another acr sd xD
05:19:17 : Group: Logan: was that you?

05:40:25 : Group: Daryl: at least 3
05:40:28 : Group: Daryl: likely with m2's

05:41:49 : Group: Logan: pustoshka or vybor?w
05:41:52 : Group: Daryl: if not the southeast woods, or the building right next to it (Good luck getting that close lol)
