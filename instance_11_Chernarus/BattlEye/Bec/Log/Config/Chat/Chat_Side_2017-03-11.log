14:17:40 : Side: Praetaer: I'm bad though
14:17:59 : Side: Cubeski: soo
14:18:12 : Side: Praetaer: I get killed fast
14:18:34 : Side: Cubeski: then think things through and dont die fast
14:18:51 : Side: Praetaer: And don't know where to find people to snipe :3
14:19:00 : Side: Cubeski: everywhere
14:19:04 : Side: Cubeski: points of interest
14:19:30 : Side: 2DIE4:  just remember it is not allowed to camp trader zones
14:19:58 : Side: Cubeski: but staying on the road to the trader is
14:20:08 : Side: Cubeski: with a mine and a mk48
14:20:16 : Side: 2DIE4:  u exactly know what i mean
14:20:24 : Side: Cubeski: ;p
14:20:28 : Side: Praetaer: Ah so set traps ect
14:20:34 : Side: Cubeski: yeah
14:20:58 : Side: Cubeski: the most common path for people is between nwaf and stary
14:20:58 : Side: 2DIE4:  if u can afford satchels for 800K a piece  XD
14:21:04 : Side: Praetaer: Do the bandit class things spawn with better loot
14:21:09 : Side: Cubeski: 800k is about 30 mins ... including driving
14:21:14 : Side: Praetaer: I'll see what I can do I have 15k at the moment
14:21:23 : Side: Cubeski: and who said satchels ? i said mines
14:21:43 : Side: Cubeski: praetaer the most common pathway for people is the road up from kabanino
14:21:49 : Side: Cubeski: towards vvybor
14:21:50 : Side: Praetaer: Oh
14:21:59 : Side: Cubeski: and down to dichina
14:22:00 : Side: 2DIE4:  well but setting up a  trap 4   a vehicle with a  800K explosive makes no sense  =?) 
14:22:02 : Side: Cubeski: or up to novy sobor
14:22:14 : Side: Cubeski: 2die4 me , it does , 
14:22:20 : Side: Cubeski: u might be carrying good stuff
14:22:25 : Side: 2DIE4: like in iraq firing friggin 100k bombs at 30$ tents
14:22:37 : Side: Praetaer: Ahahahhaha
14:22:42 : Side: 2DIE4:  well what kinda good stuff would be worth 800k?  =) 
14:22:46 : Side: Cubeski: id do that just for the satisfaction
14:22:52 : Side: Cubeski: as 50 , cheytac
14:22:56 : Side: Cubeski: base building materials
14:22:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  thats the only reason  
14:23:41 : Side: Cubeski: there is a disabled convoy missions o nthe map and nobody does it 
14:23:43 : Side: Cubeski: its funny
14:23:45 : Side: Praetaer: WHa
