02:58:35 : Side: Mike Fondu: but when he moved around i knew something was up
02:58:57 : Side: McButtMunch: yeah it's really sketchy now holding up people since they can carry guns on their backs i feel you 
02:59:12 : Side: Mike Fondu: yeah, could just shoot him straight away
02:59:22 : Side: McButtMunch: exactly
