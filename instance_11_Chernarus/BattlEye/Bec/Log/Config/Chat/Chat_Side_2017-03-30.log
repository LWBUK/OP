19:09:39 : Side: Alfie412 [BA]: different server then lol
19:09:44 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Ah okies then I don't think we can help in this case then - you can use a hotwire kit, tin bar, keymaker kit & current vehicle to break into it and 
19:09:44 : Side: Alfie412 [BA]: been on so many
19:09:48 : Side: Sierra [SD]: claim it again
19:10:25 : Side: Alex Mason: and how do i get about a hotwire kit?
19:10:39 : Side: Michigan: zombie cops
19:11:08 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: we will sell you a hotwire kit
19:11:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: mmmhmm zombies and missions
19:11:19 : Side: Alex Mason: For how much?
19:11:42 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: 1 million and the location of tralala and 2die4 base
19:11:59 : Side: Alfie412 [BA]: 4
19:12:00 : Side: MalteserHead: I know where there base is xD
19:12:06 : Side: Alex Mason: well that i cant afford
19:12:12 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: ok malteser will meet you later
19:15:27 : Side: Alex Mason: Sierra, My helicopter is at my base if that helps....
19:16:05 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it in this case.
19:16:28 : Side: Alex Mason: Can you sell me a hotwire kit maybe?
19:16:58 : Side: Alfie412 [BA]: name your price
19:17:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No sorry, we can't do that.
19:17:24 : Side: Alex Mason: i have no idea what a hotwirekit is worth
19:17:39 : Side: Alfie412 [BA]: well how much money you got
19:17:40 : Side: MalteserHead: 5-10k
19:17:50 : Side: MalteserHead: Dont let them take 100k off you
19:17:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  they r often more expensive than the vehicle u wanna hotwire  =9
19:18:09 : Side: Alex Mason: thanks, 
19:18:20 : Side: Alex Mason: Can you use it more than once?
19:18:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  nope
19:18:31 : Side: Alex Mason: alright
19:18:34 : Side: 2DIE4:  one kit one try
19:18:35 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: plus a 25% chance they will fail
19:18:52 : Side: Alex Mason: anyone who sells a kit??
19:18:56 : Side: 2DIE4:  think its 25 %b chance that it works
19:19:08 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: ok well.... i got the percentage right
19:19:24 : Side: 2DIE4:  XD
19:20:57 : Side: Alex Mason: So there are not a single person on this server atm who is welling to sell a hotwire-kit?
19:21:09 : Side: Rameses II [BA]: you not got enough
