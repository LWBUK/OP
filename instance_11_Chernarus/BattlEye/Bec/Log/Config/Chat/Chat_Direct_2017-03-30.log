19:39:21 : Direct: LWB [SD]: how can you put it in a door
19:39:31 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: just no plot poles in safes. - through a door I guess
19:40:02 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: through a cinder door
19:40:42 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that ok?
19:40:47 : Direct: LWB [SD]: yeah ofc
19:40:51 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: thought so
19:41:01 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: but its a bit of a weird question lol
19:42:00 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh I wonder....
19:42:06 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: if they mean over the lock of a door
19:42:14 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: to make it extra secure
19:42:36 : Direct: LWB [SD]: but you get lock option on the whole foor
19:42:38 : Direct: LWB [SD]: door
19:42:44 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah that is true
19:42:50 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: no idea why you would do that then lol
19:43:19 : Direct: LWB [SD]: they are probably doing something to that base
19:43:44 : Direct: LWB [SD]: or planning to
19:44:24 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah lol - he is asking about putting plot poles in safes now now that i have mentioned it

19:45:09 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: nope lol
19:45:33 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: now he is saying what if he builds three safes around one but one side is left without a safe so you can get to it that way lol
19:45:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: complicated :D
