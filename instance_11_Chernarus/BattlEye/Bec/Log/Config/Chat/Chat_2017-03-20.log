09:46:44 : Vehicle: Mike Fondu: haha
09:47:03 : Vehicle: Mike Fondu: I had to go play some Overwatch with a friend 
09:47:08 : Vehicle: Mike Fondu: thats why i left

09:54:10 : Side: Mike Fondu: and for later use, you can also double click on the map to make marks
09:54:30 : Side: Mike Fondu: so if you have it on group channel, you can make marks only you and your group can see
09:54:39 : Side: Mike Fondu: easier for collin to explain where he died
09:55:17 : Side: Mike Fondu: you delete those by holding over, and pressing delete
09:56:25 : Side: SEN ONE: if glass is damaged it wont matter right
09:57:07 : Side: Mike Fondu: nah, i like to fly in 1st person, so it would annoy the living shit out of me,
