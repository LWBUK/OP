04:59:51 : Side: Logan: i didnt steal it, my friend did and i just wanted to see what vehicle it went to
05:00:00 : Side: Logan: but i had it so technically i did i guess
05:00:18 : Side: Daryl: ohhh my bad
05:00:23 : Side: Daryl: i can bring you your heli tho
05:00:39 : Side: Daryl: i only shot bc i wanted to see if youd take the car if you had the key
05:00:42 : Side: Logan: nah its fine, you can keep it, just think of it as a gift
05:00:46 : Side: Daryl: fr?
05:01:03 : Side: Logan: i was trying to steal your vehicle so you got it fair and square
05:01:09 : Side: Daryl: you sure?
05:01:14 : Side: Daryl: i dont really need a heli
05:01:31 : Side: Logan: Yeah, or if you want you can pick me up and we can do missions and whatever together
05:01:42 : Side: Daryl: sure im down, where you spawn?
05:01:54 : Side: Logan: im seriously not salty about it and im a fresh spawn so it wont matter
05:02:00 : Side: Logan: im close to petrovka
05:02:17 : Side: Logan: i inv you to a grou[
05:02:21 : Side: Logan: group
05:03:06 : Group: Logan: ill start riding my bike towards you
05:03:13 : Group: Daryl: ok
05:05:16 : Group: Daryl: :D
05:05:26 : Group: Daryl: what mission you wanna do?
05:05:33 : Group: Logan: these guns have ammo so if you can fly by a mission i can shoot
05:05:53 : Group: Logan: lets do disabled HMMWV
05:06:06 : Group: Logan: the bandit one to the west of us
05:06:09 : Group: Daryl: il fly by slow but if they have gunners wel have to leave em
05:06:19 : Group: Logan: youre right
05:06:36 : Group: Daryl: they probably will have gunners tbh
05:06:50 : Group: Daryl: i can land at a camp and try to get you a sniper?
05:06:53 : Group: Logan: if they dont have m2s we might be fine
05:07:04 : Group: Logan: if they have gunners we can do that
05:07:19 : Group: Daryl: lol it just despawned
05:07:27 : Group: Logan: Yeah.....
05:07:40 : Group: Logan: we can go to a camp and see what loot they have
05:07:40 : Group: Daryl: convoy definetley has lots of gunners
05:07:53 : Group: Logan: go to novy camp
05:08:05 : Group: Daryl: you gonna shoot the ai from heli?
05:08:08 : Group: Daryl: or go in on foot
05:08:20 : Group: Logan: heli and if you take fire just land and we can get them on foot
05:10:17 : Group: Daryl: think its clear?
05:10:25 : Group: Daryl: 1 more
05:10:57 : Group: Logan: out of ammo
05:11:10 : Group: Logan: lets get him on foot
05:14:40 : Group: Daryl: mk17 cco
05:15:49 : Group: Logan: the reason i shot so much in the heli is because it didnt give me any kills on my debug console
05:16:01 : Group: Daryl: ahh yeah i figured it wouldnt
05:16:18 : Group: Daryl: i think its something with armed vehicles that arent in normal epoch
05:16:38 : Group: Daryl: thats why like only gunners shoot at overwatch/militarized mod vehicles
05:17:25 : Group: Daryl: lmk if you find any dmr mags, might need some for that mission
05:18:06 : Group: Daryl: acr sd
05:18:38 : Group: Daryl: another acr sd xD
