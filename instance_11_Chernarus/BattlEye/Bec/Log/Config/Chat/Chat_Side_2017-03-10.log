09:56:52 : Side: Rocket: Ferbot fack you
11:03:06 : Side: ferbot: yes
12:14:19 : Side: Thijs: this AI is so annoying xD
12:16:22 : Side: ferbot: skurvený žebrak pojebem ti mater
12:17:39 : Side: NoobeCZECH: can i somehow get into my car when i lost key ?
12:18:05 : Side: Turmoil: if you lost key and vehicle is locked you will need to aquire a hotwire kit
12:18:47 : Side: NoobeCZECH: and can i ask where i can get it ?
12:19:20 : Side: Turmoil: hard missions often have em, mayers mansion has a chance of spawning em, bandit stronghold missions etc 
12:19:35 : Side: NoobeCZECH: ok thx
12:20:10 : Side: Turmoil: if you get a keymakers kit and you have another key in your inventory slot, you can claim vehicle and add it to a new key 
12:20:28 : Side: Turmoil: but then the vehicle MUST be unlocked, it will not work whit locked vehicles
12:21:29 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: i want to get analy penetrated
12:21:41 : Side: NoobeCZECH: i hope u will get
12:21:49 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: haha mad?
12:21:55 : Side: Twanyboy: We all know that
12:21:59 : Side: Twanyboy: and we hate you for it
12:22:13 : Side: Turmoil: i belive you will find many websites that could help you out whit that :) 
12:22:13 : Side: NoobeCZECH: hiding bodyes is the biggest bullshit
12:22:32 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: haha you had literally nothing good
12:22:47 : Side: NoobeCZECH: i had my fcking keys
12:23:09 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: sick i died to ais so yea
12:23:47 : Side: Thijs: that supression mechanic is just annoying xD
12:27:22 : Side: NoobeCZECH: and the biggest bullshit is that i died cuz of immortal zombie -.-
12:28:17 : Side: Turmoil: im sorry to say that its nothing we can do about immortal zombies, that is a bug related to the game itself and not the servers script :)
12:28:59 : Side: NoobeCZECH: i played here all night and after about 10 hours here i got nothing..
12:29:19 : Side: Turmoil: what you mean nothing? 
12:29:22 : Side: Thijs: playing all night is unhealthy
12:29:27 : Side: NoobeCZECH: yea it is
12:29:56 : Side: NoobeCZECH: nothing means i got killed by immortal zombie and lost my keys from my car where i have all my money
12:30:24 : Side: Twanyboy: It's Butters ! ' Hey that's me '
12:30:32 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: you mean when i killed u 2?
12:31:43 : Side: NoobeCZECH: i mean u killed me cuz i can't do anything with that zombie. so i got bleeding and u killed me
12:31:58 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: sick
12:32:02 : Side: NoobeCZECH: u can't know where i was before that fcking zombie attack me
12:32:08 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: but that dosent mean u died to the zombie
12:32:15 : Side: Turmoil: N.W.A killed you? or zombie killed you?
12:32:19 : Side: NoobeCZECH: that mean i died cuz of zombie
12:32:24 : Side: Twanyboy: One direction
12:32:28 : Side: Thijs: calm yo tittiez yo
12:32:31 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: i killed them both twice
12:32:45 : Side: NoobeCZECH: i was on the ground camping and immortal zombie starts to attack me and i want to shoot him buit can't kill him
12:32:52 : Side: Twanyboy: Mirrors on the wall
12:32:58 : Side: Turmoil: well, then its a legit kill, so i cant really do nothing about it
12:33:00 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: but for me u did kill it
12:33:17 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: and why would u shoot it with m110 when u had a silenced pistol?
12:33:33 : Side: NoobeCZECH: "legit kill" when he didnt know about me before i must ran out
12:34:22 : Side: Turmoil: well, DayZ is a zombie surival, imagine it beeing real life situation, probably same thing would have happend
12:34:36 : Side: ferbot: but zombie wont to kill my friend and i shot zombie
12:34:46 : Side: NoobeCZECH: yea i will meet immortal zombie *clap* *clap*
12:35:13 : Side: Turmoil: not my point, like i said some bugs are bohemia and we cannot do anything about those unfortunatly 
12:35:26 : Side: Twanyboy: Drop it
12:35:30 : Side: Turmoil: and if the zombie had killed you i would gladly have unlocked your vehicle for you also :)
12:36:15 : Side: Turmoil: but when another players kills you in a legitimally way there is nothing i can do about it, zombies fault or not
12:36:37 : Side: ferbot: but u can give us our two keys. thats all what we want, nothing more when that was a bug of the game  
12:36:51 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: but u didnt die to the zombie
12:36:54 : Side: N.W.A. Eric: drop it
12:37:37 : Side: Thijs: i got rekt by a sandbag wall and my body dissapeared.. now that's valid reason xD
12:37:55 : Side: ferbot: my friend died cuz of zombie ! u killed him but he can't do anything when he was almost dead by that zombie  
12:38:13 : Side: Turmoil: give me one sec too check the logs
12:38:26 : Side: Thijs: no need turmoil i dont need that stuff anymore

16:10:42 : Side: schovB: admin?
16:11:27 : Side: schovB: np
16:36:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: you may notice we now have banking. I would suggest you move any safe stored money into your bank. This can be done easilly whilst at the safe.
16:36:48 : Side: Jorge .: Hey
16:36:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  u mean transfere it to the account?
16:37:14 : Side: 2DIE4:  but if u bank at teh safe isnt it the same?
16:37:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: take it out of storage into your wallet, then use online banking to put it to bank
16:37:28 : Side: Jorge .: I'm a new player on this server, any website showing the rules about building and server in general?
16:37:48 : Side: LWB [SD]: you can leave it in safe if you want, but other people have accsess to that if you leave the safe open
16:37:49 : Side: 2DIE4:  well yap  thats what i mean   uyour Safe/ lockbox is basically  an ATM machine
16:38:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: but now you have global banking at atms
16:38:11 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok   =) 
16:38:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: so you can get your money away from the safe
16:38:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: website is listed on debug menu/escape menu/map etc
16:38:45 : Side: Jorge .: Thanks
16:39:09 : Side: AksiOnPc: price on part and stuff is so hige in this gam
16:39:12 : Side: AksiOnPc: game'
16:39:25 : Side: Jorge .: all servers have customed prices
16:39:45 : Side: AksiOnPc: i know
16:39:47 : Side: LWB [SD]: you can 50k by one loot run to the airfield. its really not hard to get money lol
16:40:14 : Side: AksiOnPc: why is a engine 5000 when you can buy a car for 5000 lol
16:40:39 : Side: LWB [SD]: you ever bought an engine in real life?
16:40:44 : Side: LWB [SD]: they cost a fortune
16:41:16 : Side: AksiOnPc: I work as a mechanic
16:41:17 : Side: Jorge .: you can use them to repair heli, which I guess are much more expensive than 5k.
16:41:21 : Side: AksiOnPc: no they dont xD 
16:41:45 : Side: AksiOnPc: engine parts, not rotor parts
16:41:58 : Side: Jorge .: engine is used to repair helis aswell.
16:42:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: you kidding? An engine for my car is about 12 thousand pounds
16:42:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: the car cost 7
16:42:22 : Side: AksiOnPc: what car ? 
16:42:34 : Side: LWB [SD]: Landrover discovery
16:43:36 : Side: LWB [SD]: and considering they like to snap crankshafts, its not unlikely a new engine will be needed again sometime.. yes again, its had one already
16:46:08 : Side: 2DIE4:  didnt hear u comin  XD
16:46:32 : Side: 2DIE4:  who was the lucky one?
16:46:56 : Side: Jorge .: not really lucky, you had nothing on you ;p
16:47:08 : Side: 2DIE4:  well i just spawned  XD
16:47:09 : Side: Jorge .: its shame that there is walkerzombies
16:47:14 : Side: 2DIE4:  nice shooting  =)
16:47:27 : Side: 2DIE4:  dont worry  LW is gonna fix that =9
16:48:16 : Side: Jorge .: seems a really good server tbh
16:48:31 : Side: Jorge .: I like the spawn classes
16:48:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  i got shot  =(  
16:48:41 : Side: Jorge .: almost nothing on them which is really nice
16:49:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok guilty

17:28:39 : Side: Turmoil: didnt work for me when i put it on but when i took it of and put it back on it worked fine :)
17:28:52 : Side: Turmoil: or relog xD
18:00:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: FOUND A BIG BUG WITH BANKING! DONT CHANGE CLOTHES THEN ADD TO BANK, YOU WILL LOOSE ALL PREVIOUS AMOUNT
18:00:27 : Side: Din: WTF???
18:00:51 : Side: Din: aaaaaa
18:00:55 : Side: Din: lol)
18:02:57 : Side: LWB [SD]: AND DYING WIPES THE BANK. DONT USE BANKING FOR NOW
18:06:14 : Side: schovB: is online banking the same as bank ATM?
18:07:16 : Side: schovB: ok
18:10:24 : Side: schovB: why are there 2 vehicle pounds on the map?
18:11:12 : Side: Turmoil: probably a minor glitch, i do recommend every player to take a look up there at every restart, might get lucky :)
18:15:13 : Side: schovB: also the mozzies are 40000 coins, is that a bug
18:15:14 : Side: schovB: ?
18:17:37 : Side: schovB: good :)

19:21:40 : Side: Black Jesus: Yo, hows tings guys
19:22:08 : Side: schovB: nvm now im back to 30
19:22:28 : Side: schovB: i think it's all the custom buildings that lag me out
19:22:36 : Side: LWB [SD]: depends where you are. I get between 30+ 70
19:24:46 : Side: schovB: it's different for some servers i noticed
19:25:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: yeah, we do have quite a lot of custom stuff which doesnt help
19:25:31 : Side: LWB [SD]: but makes the server a bit different
19:27:18 : Side: schovB: where did everybody go?
19:27:27 : Side: schovB: the server was packed just 10 min ago
19:28:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: it restarted, I guess its dinner time lol

20:02:41 : Side: Blackjack Mulligan: ok
21:15:41 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: admin?
21:21:13 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: are you going to fix those prices or just ban all for knowing that you can combine M24 mags into DMR ones?
21:22:04 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: ok
21:50:29 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: Ok
22:06:13 : Side: Turmoil: CziQita - the prices should be altered already
22:06:22 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: good
22:06:49 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: you could also make rules more clear :)
22:07:06 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: to make sure everyone will understand them in 100%
22:07:16 : Side: Sami: secks
22:07:27 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: and to prevent situations like one yesterday
22:07:36 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: the one*
22:08:11 : Side: Turmoil: well, i dont want to offend either you guys OR LWB, but i guess its common sence that any exploit in the game should rather be reported rather than us
22:08:13 : Side: Turmoil: used :)
22:08:34 : Side: Turmoil: but like i said earlier, i dont have much other knowledge of the case other than i know you got a 24h ban 
22:08:44 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: it wasn't exploit
22:08:54 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: you set the prices
22:09:10 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: not the game
22:09:39 : Side: Turmoil: yes, but we are not robots, we are just as likely to do a mistake as everyone else :) but for the future, report and in many cases get rewarded insted
22:09:42 : Side: Turmoil:  :) 
22:09:49 : Side: <eXp> RafcioZG: kay
22:10:03 : Side: Turmoil: that way everyone gains from it :) 
22:10:45 : Side: Turmoil: we can make better server and hopefully make it more fair for everybody and yeah, might also be a reward in it for reporting in stuff, depending on
22:10:47 : Side: Turmoil: what it is 
22:11:11 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: reward us, somehow we gave you an info about it
22:11:23 : Side: <eXp> RafcioZG: :DD
22:11:32 : Side: <eXp> Gruby: XDD
22:12:11 : Side: Turmoil: hehe, like i told you earlier i dont know the specific details so that is something you would have to discuss whit LWB
22:12:46 : Side: <eXp> RafcioZG: =D
22:12:55 : Side: <eXp> CziQita: lol
