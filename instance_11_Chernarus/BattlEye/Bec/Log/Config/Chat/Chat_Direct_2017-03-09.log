11:47:17 : Direct: Turmoil: knock knock, permission to enter?
11:47:28 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: yeah, you can come :D
11:47:42 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: sup
11:47:54 : Direct: Turmoil: just walking around a bit, checking that everyone is doing ok :)
11:48:11 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: okay, as you can see me and my friends gonna build some walls here
11:48:20 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: i'm preparing stuff
11:48:25 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, this is a populare place to build also ^^
11:48:40 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: i love this place, it reminds me old good times :D
11:48:58 : Direct: Turmoil: remember to close up the hole in the roof xD
11:49:05 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: yeah :D
11:49:21 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: this cave has some secret entrances :D
11:49:52 : Direct: Turmoil: i never looked to much into that, i got a base on a different server than this, but i only played Arma since december so dont know about all the secre
11:49:55 : Direct: Turmoil: secrets :)
11:50:30 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: you can get on top of that rock and get in here through holes
11:50:39 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: it might be risky
11:50:58 : Direct: Turmoil: lol i would imagine, i broke my legs a few times trying to raid the base on the other server i play regulare on 
11:51:04 : Direct: Turmoil: in this cave xD
11:51:04 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: :D
11:51:33 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: I saw that i can buy a chainsaw for 40000 coins, i think it's too cheap
11:52:21 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah might be, i would suggest you take up anything regarding prices and server issues (technical) whit lwb as he is the one that does all scripts :)
11:52:42 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: oh okay
11:53:06 : Direct: Turmoil: im merely a humble helper to free up some time for him :)
11:53:13 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: and one question, if i don't maintain plotpole base will disappear automaticly?
11:53:30 : Direct: Turmoil: if its the same as epoch server they run, not instantly, it will gradually decay
11:53:41 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: okay
11:54:03 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: admins will build bases? :D
11:54:07 : Direct: Turmoil: but whit the new epoch 1.0.6.1 it might disapear faster, i do belive LWB has a deal in place if you are going away for more than one week tho
11:54:10 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: as regular players?
11:54:44 : Direct: Turmoil: not sure yet, since there are so many people who scream admin abuse as soon as we do anything, lol
11:54:56 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: admins often get salty, when they find out who raided their bases :D
11:55:25 : Direct: Turmoil: lol, i can imagine... the clue to be a admin is to have nothing to lose, then you wont get affected if you get raided :)
11:55:49 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: :)
11:56:35 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: okay i will log off and wait for my friends to help me building
11:56:45 : Direct: Turmoil: roger that, hope you enjoy your stay here :)
11:56:51 : Direct: <eXp> RafcioZG: sure i will :P
